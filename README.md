# Go Beyond the Numbers: Translate Data into Insights

**Course three of seven in the Google Advanced Data Analytics Professional Certificate program.**

This repository contains the projects and key learnings from the "**Go Beyond the Numbers: Translate Data into Insights**" course, focusing on the essential skills of exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, and data storytelling.

---

## Course Modules

### Module 1: Find and Share Stories Using Data

Learned about the foundational role of **data storytelling** and how to discover insights through **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** and **data cleaning**.Also covered different ways to visualize data to suit various data types and audiences.

### Module 2: Explore Raw Data

Focused on using powerful Python functions and libraries to make sense of **raw data**. Practiced performing EDA, with an emphasis on discovering and structuring data as part of the **PACE workflow**.

### Module 3: Clean Your Data

Utilized Python notebooks to learned and perform three more EDA practices: **cleaning, joining, and validating data**.

### Module 4: Data Visualizations and Presentations

Learned at an advanced level how to create and present data stories in a professional and accessible way through **Tableau**.

### Module 5: End-of-Course Project: TikTok Claims Classification Project

The final project involved conducting an **exploratory data analysis** on a TikTok dataset to prepare for a future machine learning model to classify user submissions as "claims".
* [cite_start]**Data imbalance**: The project found an imbalance in video counts between "claims" and "opinions"[cite: 8].

[cite_start]These insights from the EDA will inform the parameters of the future machine learning model[cite: 8, 9].
